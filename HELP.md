### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
* [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/)
* [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/)

### Docker Compose support
This project contains a Docker Compose file named `compose.yaml`.
In this file, the following services have been defined:

* postgres: [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
* redis: [`redis:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.

## jte

This project has been configured to use [jte precompiled templates](https://jte.gg/pre-compiling/).

However, to ease development, those are not enabled out of the box.
For production deployments, you should remove

```properties
gg.jte.development-mode=true
```

from the `application.properties` file and set

```properties
gg.jte.use-precompiled-templates=true
```

instead.
For more details, please take a look at [the official documentation](https://jte.gg/spring-boot-starter-4/).

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
